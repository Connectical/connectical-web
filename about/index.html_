					<div id="beginning">Connectical history begins at December 2007, in that year the guys which
					create Connectical lost their time developing code and promoting free
					software at one of the <acronym title="Linux User Group">LUG</acronym>s
					which exists arround the world. Due to they usually works together in
					a number of projects, they decide to create a <em>platform</em> to
					publish their code and collaborate with other
					ones.</div></li>
					<li class="article"><a class="mread" href="#fstage">First age</a>
					<div id="fstage">In January 2008, they decide to buy the Connectical domains (.org,
					.net and .com) and the site becomes in a lab central point where upload
					the projects and the ideas than they was working in. In that age
					we still working on a number of sysadmin utilities and participating
					in a number of local talks.</div></li>
					<li class="article"><a class="mread" href="#buss">Arriving profit</a>
					<div id="soc">With the arise of the web 2.0 and the collaborative sites, like <a
					href="http://github.com">github</a> or <a href="http://gitorious.com">gitorious</a>,
					more of the sense of the initial Connectical was gone. At that moment
					(Jun 2008) they promote Connectical to the point of bussiness startup.
					At the same time a number of projects that we began years ago was grown,
					and many of this projects was adopted by third party companies.
					During this age, Connectical company was categorized as <acronym
						title="Iniciativa de Empleo de Base TecnolÃ³gica" lang="es" xml:lang="es">IEBT</acronym>
					(technology-based startup), by the <a
						href="http://udc.es">University of A Corunna</a>, and we received
					also the posibility to have an office in the <a lang="gl" xml:lang="gl"

					<li class="article"><a class="mread" href="#sndage">Second age</a>
					<div id="sndage">
					Ironically, live in the companies is not a blue dream, many ideas
					cannot be developed as we think that we must do, so the Connectical big
					aim are now more live than ever...  Here started the second age of Connectical.</div></li>
